Summary:

	- Deployment:
		- I will set up a Google Cloud Compute webserver for our project 

	- Front End:
		- ReactJS
		- Modified UI from Chat App Client
		- Deployed to https://SentimentScore.appspot.com for example

	- Back End:
		- Python 

		- Modules:
			- Both models will define a function:
				predict(text: str) -> float

			- Deep Neural Network Model
				- Architecture implemented and trained in Keras

			- Naive Bayes Model

		- Server:
			- REST architecture that will support two endpoints:

			```POST https://SentimentScore.appspot.com/api/score/DNN```
			```POST https://SentimentScore.appspot.com/api/score/NBayes```


	- Example Flow of Control
		1. Client browser loads webpage https://SentimentScore.appspot.com

		2. Client browser loads modified chat app UI

		3. User clicks a button to pick whether or not to select: { DNN model or NBayes model }

		4. User enters into message box text: "Machine learning has way too much math"

		5. User presses send button

		6. React UI makes a HTTP request to the our backend api endpoint to the 
			```
			URL:
				POST https://SentimentScore.appspot.com/api/score/DNN 		(if DNN button was selected)
				POST https://SentimentScore.appspot.com/api/score/DNN 		(if NBayes button was selected)
			Header:
				Content-Type: application/json
			Request Body:
				{
					"text" : "Machine learning is terrible because there is too math"
				}
			```

		7. API receives and routes request to the appropriate ML model

		8. ML model receives the text and calls predict(text: str) -> float

		9. predict() analyses the text and outputs a probabiltiy value between 0 and 1 				{ 0 is most negative, 1 is most positive }

		10. Probability value is scaled and rounded to a value between 0 and 5 and returned to API 	{ 0 is most negative, 5 is most positive }		

		11. API generates and serves HTTP response to the fufill the request
			Header:
				Content-Type: application/json
			Response Body:
				{
					"score" : 0
				}
			```

		12. React parses the response, based on the score it received highlights one of the boxes {0 through 5} to show user the predicted sentiment score of their text

		13. Repeat starting from step #3 until client leaves webpage
